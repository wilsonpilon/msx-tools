# Code of Conduct

The FINAL CUT Project aims to be a welcoming place and we ask that everyone 
who interacts with the project and the larger community treat each other 
with dignity and respect. Individuals who do not behave in this manner will 
be warned and asked to adjust their behavior; in extreme cases, individuals 
could get excluded from the project.

Examples of inappropriate behavior include profane, offensive, or 
prejudicial language directed at another person, vandalism, or spam.
