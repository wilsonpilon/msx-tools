Description: Shared library for the final cut widget toolkit
 FINAL CUT is a class library and widget toolkit with full mouse
 support for creating a text-based user interface. The library supports
 the programmer to develop an application for the text console. It allows
 the simultaneous handling of multiple windows on the screen.

 The C++ class design was inspired by the Qt framework. It provides
 common controls like dialog windows, push buttons, check boxes,
 radio buttons, input lines, list boxes, status bars and so on.

 This package contains the shared library necessary to run programs
 compiled with the final cut.
